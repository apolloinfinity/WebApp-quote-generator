# WebApp-quote-generator
I looked fear straight in the eyes and told it no more. 

This is a FreeCodeCamp project that is required to be completed as part of their Front-end curriculum. 

I used VanillaJS with this project instead of using JQuery or any other framework.

## Here is what I learned. 
1. I learned a great deal of JavaScript and how it is used to manipulate and update the DOM. 
2. I created a AJAX call and made that into a function so I can use it anywhere that needed to fetch the JSON file.
3. I learned how to parse JSON data into an array and then used Math.random() to fetch a random quote in the array. 
4. I also learned how to use anonymous function expressions and event listeners and used them on certain elements.
5. I found a small neat library to create the star field from [VincentvGarreau](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/)
6. Most importantly, it was fun building this project and it greatly expanded my understanding of JavaScript and its power. 


### Updates for this repo
*[] Make Mobile friendly
*[] Possibly update from using AJAX Api to using Axios library to better understand it.
